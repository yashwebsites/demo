                    frontend. on the other hand, everything that happens in the backgroud can be attributed to the
                    backend. Languages used for the front end are HTML, CSS and Javascript while those used for the
                    backend include java,Ruby, Python, and.</p>

                <h2 class="h-secondary center">BACK-END WEBSITE</h2>
                <p class="center">In the computer world, the "backend" refers to any part of a website or software
                    program that users do not see. It contrasts with the frontend, which refers to a program's or
                    website's user interface. In programming terminology, the backend is the "data access layer," while
                    the frontend is the "presentation layer."

                    Most modern websites are dynamic, meaning webpage content is generated on-the-fly. A dynamic page
                    contains one or more scripts that run on the web server each time the page is accessed. These
                    scripts generate the content of the page, which is sent to the user's web browser. Everything that
                    happens before the page is displayed in a web browser is part of the backend.</p>

            <P class="u">We all do some kind of a work either to earn our live hood or to make a career. Hobby is
                something which
                we enjoy doing, we like indulging ourselves in the activity during our leisure or free time. We all have
                our likes and dislike. We enjoy doing something more than others. A hobby gives us pleasure for we do
                it, for the love of the work and not under compulsion to earn. Thus, it is more fulfilling and gives us
                more satisfaction and joy.

                Pursuing a hobby also increase one's efficiency, interest and ability. It gives an opportunity to full
                development of one's various aspects of personality. Hobbies like collecting stamps, listening music,
                drawing, gardening, playing an indoor or outdoor sport, writing, reading, bird watching, collecting
                antiques, photography etc, are very educative. We learn many things with practical insights which we
                cannot learn from.
